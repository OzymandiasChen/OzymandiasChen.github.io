About Me
------

Hi! My name is 陈曦 (CHEN Xi). I am currently a Ph.D. student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Before that, I received my master's degree in Computer Technology from Fudan University and bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Dalian University of Technology.

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of Artificial Intelligence and its application in Audio Signal Processing, including but not limited to Multimodal/Speech/Music Emotion Recognition, Singing Voice Detection, and Text-to-Speech Synthesis. Moreover, since many have gained insights and inspiration from NLP/CV, I am happy to access and even contribute my efforts to these areas.
